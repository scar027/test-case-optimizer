# Test Case Optimizer
A program to create a dataset storing `o` sets of `m` random binary numbers of `n` bit data as input and their corrsponding optimized output sequence.

## Build
- On Mac & Linux:
1. Create a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```
1. Activate the virtual environment.
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```    
1. Install `networkx` library using pip.
    ```bash
    pip install networkx
    ```

## Run
1. Run the console.py file to test the accuracy of the algorithms used in the program.
1. Run the main.py file after setting the `m, n, o` variables accordingly, to generate the dataset.
